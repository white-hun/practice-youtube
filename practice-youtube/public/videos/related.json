        "description": "In a classic research-based TEDx Talk, Dr. Lara Boyd describes how neuroplasticity gives you the power to shape the brain you want. Recorded at TEDxVancouver at Rogers Arena on November 14, 2015.\n\nYouTube Tags: brain science, brain, stroke, neuroplasticity, science, motor learning, identity, TED, TEDxVancouver, TEDxVancouver 2015, Vancouver, TEDx, Rogers Arena, Vancouver speakers, Vancouver conference, ideas worth spreading, great idea,\n\nOur knowledge of the brain is evolving at a breathtaking pace, and Dr. Lara Boyd is positioned at the cutting edge of these discoveries. In 2006, she was recruited by the University of British Columbia to become the Canada Research Chair in Neurobiology and Motor Learning. Since that time she has established the Brain Behaviour Lab, recruited and trained over 40 graduate students, published more than 80 papers and been awarded over $5 million in funding. \n\nDr. Boyd’s efforts are leading to the development of novel, and more effective, therapeutics for individuals with brain damage, but they are also shedding light on broader applications. By learning new concepts, taking advantage of opportunities, and participating in new activities, you are physically changing who you are, and opening up a world of endless possibility. \n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Strength? Agility? In Dr. Joseph's TEDx Talk, he explores self confidence and how it is not just the most important skill in athletics, but in our lives.\n \nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

        "description": "Gerçekler mutlu etmez. Ancak mutsuzluğun ve hayatın gerçeklerinin harekete geçirici etkisi vardır. Behçet Yalın Özkara eğitimin mutluluk getireceğine inandı. Bu nedenle ESOGÜ İşletmeden lisans ve doktora, Hacettepe’den Yüksek Lisans, Anadolu İktisattan lisans, Dış ticaret ve Halkla ilişkilerden ise önlisans diplomalarını aldı. Ancak elde ettiği mutluluk çok kısa sürdü. Bu sefer, Yurtdışında eğitim görerek mutluluğu yakalayacağına inandı. Seul Hanyang, Massachusetts ve Michigan üniversitelerinde bulundu. Yine olmadı. Ardından şöhret belki beni mutlu eder diye umdu. Akademiklink isimli bir youtube kanalı açtı. Behçet Yalın Özkara believed that education would lead him to happiness. For this reason, he pursued education and received several degrees; bachelor's degree and Phd. in Business at ESOGU, master at Hacettepe, bachelor's degree in Economics and associate degree in Foreign Trade and Public Relations at Anadolu University. However, the happiness he achieved didn't last long. This time, he thought he would find happiness by studying abroad. Then he's been at Hanyang University of Seoul, University of Massachusettes and University of Michigan. Happiness didn't happen again. Then he thought fame might bring him happiness. So he started a Youtube Channel named \"Akademiklink\". He is still unhappy but has full faith that someday he will be happy. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",

        "description": "Can you read someone’s mind by looking at them? Almost. Lynne Franklin teaches you how to connect with 3 types of people by understanding how their bodies communicate. After a boy threatened to kill her with a machete, Lynne Franklin decided to learn everything she could about persuasion. She became a neuroscience nerd, studying how the brain works and how to build rapport with people. She has since worked with organizations to use persuasive communication to increase their performance, productivity, and profit, and published a book about her personal research called Getting Others to Do What You Want. In addition to her marketing and consulting work, Lynne is a member of the National Speakers Association and President-elect of its Illinois chapter.
